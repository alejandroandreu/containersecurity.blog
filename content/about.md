subscribe. Essentially, I distill the latest information that has to do with container
security (news, discovered vulnerabilities, latest software releases) and send
it out every 2 weeks. Any replies will land on my inbox so constructive
discussion can take place.

Please do comment, [drop me a line](mailto:contact@alejandroandr.eu) or even
submit a [pull
request](https://github.com/alejandroandreu/containersecurity.blog/pulls) if
you feel there's a mistake in any of the posts or have any suggestion.
